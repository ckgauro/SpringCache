# üî• Apache Ignite ‚Äì Distributed Caching and In-Memory Computing Platform

## üß† What is Apache Ignite?

**Apache Ignite** is an **in-memory computing platform** that supports **distributed caching**, **data grids**, **SQL querying**, **ACID transactions**, and **compute grid** capabilities. It is designed to **store and process data in memory** across a cluster of machines, making it ideal for **high-performance**, **low-latency**, and **real-time** applications.
