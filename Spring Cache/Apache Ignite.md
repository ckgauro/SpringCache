# 🔥 Apache Ignite – Distributed Caching and In-Memory Computing Platform

## 🧠 What is Apache Ignite?

**Apache Ignite** is an **in-memory computing platform** that supports **distributed caching**, **data grids**, **SQL querying**, **ACID transactions**, and **compute grid** capabilities. It is designed to **store and process data in memory** across a cluster of machines, making it ideal for **high-performance**, **low-latency**, and **real-time** applications.

## ⚙️ Apache Ignite in Spring

Apache Ignite provides support for **Spring Cache Abstraction** via its **Spring Data Ignite** and **JCache** integrations.

### Maven Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.ignite</groupId>
  <artifactId>ignite-spring</artifactId>
  <version>2.15.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## 📊 Advantages

- 🔥 In-memory speed with optional durability
- 🌐 Scales horizontally
- 🧮 Run computations directly on the grid
- 🛡 Offers strong consistency and transactions
- 🧩 Easily integrates with Spring, JDBC, Kafka

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- 💡 Steeper learning curve than Redis or Caffeine
- 🔧 Complex cluster setup and configuration
- 📊 Overkill for simple key-value caching use cases

---

## 🧭 When to Use Apache Ignite

### ✅ Choose Ignite if you:

- Need both data and compute grid in one platform
- Want SQL + distributed transactions
- Require collocated processing of large datasets
- Are building real-time analytics or in-memory OLAP

### ❌ Avoid if you:

- Need a simple key-value store (Redis or Caffeine is better)
- Don’t require distributed compute or persistence
